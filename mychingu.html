<p> Let me introduce you to my first best friend, her name is <i>Farahdini Suhaimi</i>. We’ve known each other since primary school, though back then we weren’t that close. We only talked because we needed the same transport to school.<br> Fast forward to secondary school registration day. I randomly bumped into her and found out we were going to the same school again! From Form 1 up until now, we’ve grown to become best friends.<br> Of course, it hasn’t always been smooth sailing. We’ve had our fair share of arguments, silent treatments, and even moments when we nearly ended the friendship. But thankfully, we always found our way back to each other.<br> Right now, Farah is continuing her studies at UNISEL, so we don’t get to see each other as often since our semester breaks rarely line up. Still, we keep in touch all the time through endless chit-chat and gossip — HAHAHA.<br> On top of that, I’ve also gotten to know her family, her mommy, abah, opah, and even her uncle, who used to drive us around back in school whenever we wanted to hang out or go to the library for study groups. Farah is also an only child, just like me.</p>

<p> This is my trio, we’ve been close since Form 2 and have stayed that way ever since. We've been through so much together — arguments, silent treatments, and making up in the end.<br> In our trio, one’s the overthinker one, one’s the loud and spontaneous one, and one’s the funny one — guess who I am? HAHA.<br> This was the only time all three of us managed to meet up this year. I really miss them and can’t wait for us to hang out again.<br> Even though we’re all walking our own paths now, I really hope we’ll still stay close and keep finding time to meet up, no matter how busy life gets.</p>

<p> This is Nur Aqilah, the eldest of three siblings. She’s got a bit of a unique personality: sensitive, tends to overthink, and easily panics. She’s the type who needs to let things out, which makes sense since she’s the eldest, carrying a lot on her shoulders. In her family, she’s usually the one who gives in and keeps the peace. On the outside, she might seem tough, but deep down, she has such a soft and gentle heart.<br> We started getting close in Form 2, even though we were already in the same class since Form 1. From Form 2 to Form 5, we were inseparable, always sitting next to each other, even eating together during breaks. Our other friend, Farah, moved to the science stream in Form 4, but both Aqilah and I switched to the "sastera" stream, and that made us even closer.<br> Aqilah chose to continue her studies in Form 6 (STPM), and right now, she’s waiting for her UPU results to pursue her Bachelor’s degree. I truly hope she gets the best outcome and lands a course she loves. I also know her family, her mom, and her younger siblings.</p>

<p>These are my university friends — from the right: Bahiah, Allysa, Natasya, and me. Allysa and Tasa, have been my roommates since day one of registration, all the way until Semester 2. We were lucky enough to be placed in the same course too, which made our bond even stronger.<br> I got to know Bahi because we were classmates, even though we weren’t in the same room. We only started getting close after working together on group assignments.<br> From Semester 3 onwards, all four of us became housemates — since we didn’t get a college dorm anymore, hihihi. Bahiah is the funny one, always cracking jokes and being a little goofy, and she's from Tanah Merah, Kelantan. Allysa is cheerful and always willing to lend a hand, and she's from Senai, Johor. And Tasa, even though she can be a little fierce (typical middle child vibes), she’s the one who’s constantly there for me, especially when it comes to helping with studies, and she's from Kuala Terengganu.<br>Alhamdulillah, I’m truly grateful to have such wonderful friends like them in my life. And they will always be a precious part of my memories throughout my diploma journey.</p>

<p>Here we are, playing UNO at the beginning of Semester 3, our lecturer for that subject hadn’t shown up yet, so we had some free time.<br> At home, we sometimes play card games like UNO, SNAP, and Happy Family during our free time. It brings back memories of our school days, simple moments that still make us smile and laugh.

<p> These are some of our other classmates, and we decided to film a video just for fun. At the time, TikTok was full of trends where people made videos for their future kids to watch one day HAHAHA, just us being extra and imagining the future.<br>
In the video were Aleeya, Nabihah, and Najwa. (Apologies if any words or actions came off the wrong way, it was all just for laughs and good memories)</p>

<p> This is Nabihah, my classmate. She’s small and cute in person. At first, she seems quiet and introverted, but once you get to know her, she’s actually pretty funny too. Nabihah is from Johor.</p>
   <img src="image/uni friend 1.jpg" alt="chingu image" width="260">
<p>This is Aleeya, she’s from Setapak, Kuala Lumpur. Aleeya is cheerful, loves to laugh, and is always up for a good chat. She was born just after me, on December 13 — HAHAHA, if it were just a little earlier, we could’ve had twin birthdays!<br> Aleeya’s also a great cook! She often shares posts about what she’s been cooking!
