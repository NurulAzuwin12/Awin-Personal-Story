  <h2 style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 20px;"> KINDERGARTEN ERA </h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> I went to kindergarten at <b>Tadika Islam Othmaniah, Ipoh, Perak</b>. I also participated in a nasyid singing competition, but I don't remember which nasyid song it was, but that's what sparked my interest in nasyid music until now. I like songs from the groups <b><i>Rabbani, Raihan, Inteam, UNIC, </b>and <b>Hijjaz</b></i><br> I still remember, I used to cry all the time when I had to go there, because I didnâ€™t have many friends (I was actually an introvert even as a child), sometimes the kindergarten teacher would be my friend, playing with clay with me, HAHAHA I miss those memories. Anddd actually, the kindergarten was just behind my house, so I had no excuse for not attending. Then, many kindergarten friends who entered primary school and religious school just like me.</p>

     <h2 style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 20px;"> PRIMARY SCHOOL ERA </h2>
    <p style=text-align:center;"> I studied at Sekolah Kebangsaan Silibin from Year 1 to Year 6. Like most schools, it had morning assemblies, exams, and a lot of homework. I wasnâ€™t the most outstanding student, but I did okay. It is the place where I learned all the basics â€” reading, writing, and counting. Some days were fun, and some were just tiring, especially during long assemblies under the sun. I wasnâ€™t very active in school events, but I still have a few memories I remember to this day, like waiting for the bell to ring for recess. I had a small group of friends and we used to eat together. There were times when I forgot my homework and got scolded, and times when I got a star sticker for neat handwriting. Overall, it was a simple part of my childhood that Iâ€™ll always remember in my own way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the evenings, I attended Sekolah Rendah Agama Rakyat Osmaniah (SRAR) nearby my house, also, where I learned about Islam â€” from reading the Iqra', Qurâ€™an, performing solat, and understanding basic Islamic teachings. Although it was tiring to go to school again after morning classes, I truly enjoyed being there. My ustazah taught me to always be kind to others, and that knowledge is not just about books, but also how we treat people. It was a meaningful part of my childhood and shaped who I am today.

    <div class="column-left">
    <img src="image/smkdmk 2.jpg" alt="smkdmk image" width="285">
   <p style="text-align:center;"> My classmates from Form 1 to Form 3. Some were loud, some were quiet. We had fun, argued, and helped each other when needed. It was just a normal school life with normal people â€” nothing too dramatic, but still meaningful in its own way. What's special is that we are the first batch who didn't have to take the Form 3 Examination (PT3) due to the outbreak of COVID-19. At that time, online classes began, and all the students were happy to just stay at home, but not everyone could focus on studying using Google Meet HAHAHA. </p>

  <img src="image/smkdmk 1.jpg" alt="smkdmk image" width="350">
  <p style=text-align:center;"> SMK Doktor Megat Khas, also known as DMK, is located in Jalan Labrooy, Ipoh. The environment is calm and not too hectic, but just right for studying and making friends.
This was where I grew up as a secondary school student â€” going through the usual routines, classes that were sometimes boring but still filled with memories, and teachers with all kinds of personalities. DMK may look ordinary from the outside, but it holds many memories that are hard to forget. Itâ€™s the place where I experienced the ups and downs of my teenage years.</p>

 <div class="column-right">
    <img src="image/smkdmk 3.jpg" alt="smkdmk image" width="350">
    <p style="text-align: center;"> In Form 4 and Form 5, I was in the Ekonomi dan Perniagaan stream. My classmates were more focused, but still had their own chaos. In our studies, some parts were okay, some were confusing. Everyone started to get more serious because of SPM, but we still laughed, shared snacks, and panicked before exams together. It was stressful sometimes, but going through it with them made things a bit better. At this point in life, I truly value my friendship with them because, well, weâ€™ve all matured, havenâ€™t we? Iâ€™m proud of where they are now â€” some are continuing their studies in college or university, while others have already started working to support themselves.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;"> Back then in Semester 1, we were CDIM1441C â€” still strangers, always asking for names we couldnâ€™t remember! ðŸ¤£<br> I began my journey at UiTM Kedah in September 2023. I was offered the Diploma in Library Informatics through UPU, which was my second choice. I used to struggle with homesickness, but look at me now! Iâ€™ve made it to Semester 4. Alhamdulillah, just one more semester to go!ðŸ’ª

    <p style="text-align:center;"> Hereâ€™s a picture of us in Semester 3. By then, weâ€™d gone through a lot together â€” group projects, late-night study sessions, and of course, lots of laughs in between. It felt like we were slowly becoming a little family. <br> One day, these moments will just be memories, but Iâ€™m so grateful I got to share them with this class. âœ¨</p>
