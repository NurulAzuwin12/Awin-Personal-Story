    <p> We travelled to Batam and returned by ferry through the ferry terminal in Johor. Actually, this trip to Batam was a last-minute plan. Coincidentally, my aunt had a friend in Johor who invited us to go on a short getaway to Batam. We stayed there for 2 days and 1 night, and spent the night at Vanilla Hotel. The trip took place in June 2023. </p>

    <p> This was the transport we used throughout our stay in Batam. The driver was a local Indonesian, very friendly and kind. He actually had a lot of places he wanted to take us to, but since our time was limited, we could only visit a few. Still, the places we managed to go were quite interesting. He also loved offering to take our photos for us. </p>

 <p>We went to Hatyai by express bus at 10:30 PM. I went along with my aunt, her younger sister, and my cousin. We went in August 2024.</p>

<p>The main transport we used while in Hatyai was the tuk-tuk. It was affordable and super fun to ride! The driver loved playing Thai songs, and even some Malaysian hits from the band Floor 88. HAHAHAHA!

 <p> We had dinner at Kaitod Decha, where I had Thai tom yum, and of course, Thai tea (sorry, no photo). After that, we stopped by the ASEAN Night Bazaar to buy some souvenirs as memories. But honestly, if you're looking for souvenirs, it's better to get them at Samila Beach because the prices there are cheaper and much more reasonable.</p>

 <div class="row">
      <div class="column-left">
<p> Now for a local trip. I went to Terengganu by bus with a group of my momâ€™s acquaintances. We travelled in May 2025. While in Terengganu, we had the chance to visit the Crystal Mosque, go on a boat ride around the area, and even pass under the iconic drawbridge.</p>

<p> POV: Me romanticizing a simple moment in Terengganu. Just a random short video for future me to smile at ðŸ¥¹âœ¨. <br> You can hear the sound of the waves â€” Penarik Beach and the boat engine in the background â€” such a natural & peaceful vibe.</p>

 <p> That same day, we continued our journey to Kelantan and stayed at a homestay there. The next day, we visited Pasar Siti Khadijah, and as you can see, we did quite a bit of shopping!
I started my morning with a classic, nasi kerabu, and a glass of teh beng! I was especially drawn to a blouse with hand-painted batik designs; it was so beautiful. What makes it special is that each design is one-of-a-kind, so no two shirts are ever the same. After that, we made a stop at Rantau Panjang. Before heading back to Perak, we visited the famous Rumah Hijau, well-known for its delicious serunding and dodol. </p>
